============

The sketch_export.py script is a simple tool for exporting Blender objects to the [Sketch](http://www.frontiernet.net/~eugene.ressler/) scene description language.
Sketch is a small, simple system for producing line drawings of two- or three-dimensional solid objects and scenes.
Sketch outputs PGF/TikZ or PSTricks code suitable for use in TeX/LaTeX documents.
A unique feature of Sketch is that you can easily use LaTeX to annotate your drawings.

**Please note that this script only works for Blender 2.4x. It will not run on the latest version of Blender.**
